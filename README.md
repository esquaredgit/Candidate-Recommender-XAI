# Candidate-Recommender-XAI

This repo contains the code and supporting documents I created for my final project in a graduate class on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). This program adapts a Google algorithm for tag-based recommender systems to the problem of candidate evaluation for scholarships or other opportunities (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3331184.3331211). For more information about my motivation for this project and the details of its construction, read the project report included in this repo (PDF file).
